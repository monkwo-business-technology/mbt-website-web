Focus: Editorial typography, large imagery, and fluid "Brand" storytelling.

Role: You are a Senior Principal Designer and Lead Frontend Engineer at Google. Your objective is to desigchange the current web application interface that is indistinguishable from a native Google internal tool or a flagship Google Workspace application (e.g., Google Cloud Console or Gmail).

Design Framework: Material Design 3 (M3)

    Typography: Implement Google Sans for headings and Roboto for body text. Adhere strictly to Google’s type scale: Display (Large), Headline (Small/Medium), Title (Medium), and Body (Medium/Large). Use a 400-weight for body and 500/700 for emphasis.

    Color System: Use the M3 Dynamic Color logic. Primary: #1a73e8 (Google Blue). Surface: #ffffff. Surface Container: #f0f4f8. Error: #d93025. Use subtle tonal palettes for hover states (e.g., 8% opacity overlays).

    Layout & Grid: > - Use a standard Side Navigation Rail (collapsed) or Navigation Drawer (expanded) with 24px icons and 12px spacing.

        Implement a "High Density" layout suitable for productivity (8px baseline grid).

        Content should be housed in Cards with a border-radius: 16px and a 1px subtle border stroke rather than heavy shadows.

    Components:

        Buttons: Use "Filled" for primary actions, "Outlined" for secondary, and "Text" for tertiary.

        Icons: Use Material Symbols (Outlined) exclusively.

        Inputs: Use the "Filled" text field style with a 2px bottom stroke on focus.

    Motion & Interaction: Use the standard-easing (cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)) for all transitions. Include a ripple effect on all clickable elements.

Task: Chnage the current UI for design of the current web application in the root of this directory and the application front in /apps/wave-app/frontend directory that implements this system, ensuring the header includes the Google-style 'Waffle' menu, a search bar with a 24px radius, and a profile avatar.

Key Design Principles to Follow

To make your application feel authentic, keep these "Google-isms" in mind:
1. The "Waffle" and Search

Google applications almost always feature a global header with a centered, pill-shaped search bar (typically background: #f1f3f4) and the 3x3 grid "Waffle" menu icon on the far right.
2. White Space is a Feature

Google's design language has shifted from heavy shadows to tonal elevation. Instead of making a card "pop" with a black shadow, use a slightly different shade of grey or a thin 1px border (#dadce0).
3. Iconic Visuals

    Icons: Use the Material Symbols library. The "Outlined" version with a 0.75 weight is what gives the modern "Google 2026" look.

    Illustrations: Google uses a style called "Abbott Miller" or "Open Peeps" style—flat, friendly, and often using the four brand colors (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green).
